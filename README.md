# SQL Superstore Sales Analytics

## Tools
- SQLite / DB Browser for SQLite
- Basic SQL (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, date formatting, etc)

## What this Project Currently Covers
- doing basic exploration  
- working with dates stored as text (e.g., `6/16/2016`)  
- simple aggregations
More advanced analytics (KPIs, dashboards, window functions, etc.) will be added later.

## Planned Improvements
- Create business KPIs (sales, profit margin, repeat customers, etc.)
- Add window functions and CTEs
- Build more meaningful analytical questions
- Possibly connect to Power BI/Tableau later

This README and the queries will keep getting updated as I learn.
